# Warzone-Game

## Description
Hi... welcome to the "Call of Duty Warzone Sound Game" (The name needs work...) Please try it out! Wether you are a Warzone fan/player or just curious to see what it is I would love for you to give it a try! This was built in React and all of the sounds and images are taken straight from the game by me. Some of the functions and aspects could be broken out further into components but that is something I want to revisit later! 
Thanks for visiting checking it out!
